## Tweakers Developers Summit 2020 - Moshe Baram - Next.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app).

The idea of this project is to show the basics of Next.js, its capabilities, and common issues.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn start`

Starts the application in production mode.
The application should be compiled with \`next build\` first.

See the section in Next docs about [deployment](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/wiki/Deployment) for more information.

## Using CSS

[`styled-jsx`](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) is bundled with next to provide support for isolated scoped CSS. The aim is to support "shadow CSS" resembling of Web Components, which unfortunately [do not support server-rendering and are JS-only](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/71).

```jsx
export default () => (
  <div>
    Hello world
    <p>scoped!</p>
    <style jsx>{`
      p {
        color: blue;
      }
      div {
        background: red;
      }
      @media (max-width: 600px) {
        div {
          background: blue;
        }
      }
    `}</style>
  </div>
);
```

## Adding Components

We recommend keeping React components in `./components` and they should look like:

### `./components/simple.js`

```jsx
const Simple = () => <div>Simple Component</div>;

export default Simple; // don't forget to export default!
```

### `./components/complex.js`

```jsx
import { Component } from "react";

class Complex extends Component {
  state = {
    text: "World"
  };

  render() {
    const { text } = this.state;
    return <div>Hello {text}</div>;
  }
}

export default Complex; // don't forget to export default!
```

## Fetching Data

You can fetch data in `pages` components using `getInitialProps` like this:

### `./pages/stars.js`

```jsx
const Page = props => <div>Next stars: {props.stars}</div>;

Page.getInitialProps = async ({ req }) => {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.github.com/repos/zeit/next.js");
  const json = await res.json();
  const stars = json.stargazers_count;
  return { stars };
};

export default Page;
```

For the initial page load, `getInitialProps` will execute on the server only. `getInitialProps` will only be executed on the client when navigating to a different route via the `Link` component or using the routing APIs.

_Note: `getInitialProps` can **not** be used in children components. Only in `pages`._

## Custom Server

Want to start a new app with a custom server? Run `create-next-app --example customer-server custom-app`

Typically you start your next server with `next start`. It's possible, however, to start a server 100% programmatically in order to customize routes, use route patterns, etc

This example makes `/a` resolve to `./pages/b`, and `/b` resolve to `./pages/a`:

```jsx
const { createServer } = require("http");
const { parse } = require("url");
const next = require("next");

const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production";
const app = next({ dev });
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

app.prepare().then(() => {
  createServer((req, res) => {
    // Be sure to pass `true` as the second argument to `url.parse`.
    // This tells it to parse the query portion of the URL.
    const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true);
    const { pathname, query } = parsedUrl;

    if (pathname === "/a") {
      app.render(req, res, "/b", query);
    } else if (pathname === "/b") {
      app.render(req, res, "/a", query);
    } else {
      handle(req, res, parsedUrl);
    }
  }).listen(3000, err => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log("> Ready on http://localhost:3000");
  });
});
```
